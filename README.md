# ECE368-Data-Structures
Learning Objectives:

  A student who successfully fulfills the course requirements will have demonstrated:

  an understanding of various basic data structures, including stacks, queues, and trees. [a,b]

  an ability to analyze time complexity and space complexity of algorithms. [a,b]

  an ability to apply appropriate sorting and searching algorithms for a given application. [a,b,c,e,k]

  an ability to apply graph theoretic techniques, data structures and algorithms for problem solving. [a,b,c,e,k]

  an ability to design and implement appropriate data structures and algorithms for engineering applications. [a,b,c,e,k]

Assessment Method for Learning Objectives: A student who receives a passing grade must have satisfied all of the course outcomes to some minimum degree. By awarding the student a passing grade, the instructor confirms that all of the outcomes have been satisfied. Outcomes based on material covered only during the final week or two of the course should be avoided.
